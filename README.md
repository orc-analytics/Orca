[Orca](https://orc-a.io) is a analytics orchestration framework that makes it easy for
development and product teams to extract real-time insights from real-time data. It provides a
structured and scalable way to schedule, process, and analyse data, at scale, using a
time window based triggering mechanism. This means Orca is perfectly suited to tasks that involve
capturing regions of time, as they occur, and running analyses on them, whilst also allowing
dependencies between analyses and nested time windows (i.e. analysis can trigger other analyses).
