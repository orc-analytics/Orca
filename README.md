[Orca](https://orca.predixus.com) is a analytics orchestration framework that makes it easy for
development and product teams to extract insights from realworld data. It provides a
structured and scalable way to schedule, process, and analyse data, at scale, using a
time window based triggering mechanism.

We're building orca on top of production grade tooling, to power the next generation of real-world
data-powered AI.
